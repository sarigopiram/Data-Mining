8YWzrY18uC2yx3sM-cPqWg,vSEFzop2GDXsIWTLxIGMiw,"I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.

For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.

The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M. 

Not a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like ""health code violations"" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.

I ordered the ""Rolled Taco Supreme"" which is four (I think) rolled tacos piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and liberally topped with chopped, tasty carne asada chunks.  With a little pile of lettuce and a ""superior grade"" pico de gallo on the side.

My friend got a regular beef enchilada and it was stuffed with onions and green peppers.  Wtf?  I ordered the California burrito and it was very bland and not very tasty.  I had to dump salsa on every bite to liven it up a bit.  Finally when we left, my friend had filled up her drink and accidentally left it near the soda dispenser.

QfUg95ngeq5kM0nbBP-6tQ,vSEFzop2GDXsIWTLxIGMiw,"In pursuit of the Mexican guacamole/bacon/cheese/sour cream/raw onion burrito, I just was not satisfied with what I received.

Sunday afternoon, around 2 PM.  I had taken a stroll to Fry's to get the current beer of preference (Anyone know where I can find Cave Creek Chili Beer?) and on the walk home, I went past Riva's.  The location strikes me as being a drive-through banking location at some time, tho since closed and relocated.  Windows, floors, walls are clean; even the parking lot is clean.  

As the TVs played novelas, I looked at the great variety of offerings, each with a picture in pretty vivid color, along with the name and price.  On approaching the counter, I asked if I could order a custom burrito.  The lady behind the counter asked what kind of burrito I wanted.  I explained the guacamole/bacon/cheese/sour cream/onion burrito.  She asked if I wanted egg on it, and I replied I did not.  She walked the slip to the cook and described the burrito.    

When the lady behind the counter received my wrapped burrito, she put it in a bag with napkins.  I asked about salsa, and she gestured toward the salsa bar.  Since the aluminum roof was down and there was no sign, I had no idea there was a salsa bar.  I packed one container of each salsa, 1 green and 2 red, along with some carrots and jalapenos.  I must express my kudos to the green sauce, a truly fabulous presentation with enough heat to be 'bout right.  No such luck with the red sauce, which seems to derive most of it's heat from black pepper.

Arriving at home, I put the beer in the refrigerator and unwrapped the burrito.  The heft of the burrito gave me pause.  It weighed just over 1/2 lb out of the wrapper.  I was surprised to see nothing had dripped out of the burrito onto the wrapping.  As this was a Hit and Run first try, I did not go into the Preparing for the 'new restaurant first try' experience.  

First bite, I got the slack end of the burrito, so lots of extra tortilla.  Second bite, I was rewarded with meat and onion.  Third bite, I detected cheese and sour cream along with meat and onion, and at the fourth bite, I got evidence of American guacamole.  While I am not sure what size tortilla was used to create this burrito, there was certainly a lot of tortilla folded up.  

I must take the time to inquire next opportunity I get to find out where they get their ""bacon"".  It is certainly the most unusual preparation of meat.  There is gristle in addition to fat and chunks that are bigger, have different consistency and remind me strikingly of ham.  There are pieces that feel and taste similar to bacon...just hard to know what it is I am eating.

The staff is legitimately friendly and helpful, especially at odd hours of the evening. The salsa bar is adequate and includes gratis pickled carrots. The menu is far too robust to try everything and can occasionally be difficult to navigate. Seriously, it's a 10 foot spread at least.

The food is exactly what you would expect when you walk in. Compared to FiliB's, Amado's, etc. it's completely serviceable; compared to Los Taquitos, it is lacking. Rivas does nothing to separate themselves from every other 24-hour Mexican joint save for slightly more generous portions.

I was tasked with ordering a special cake two days before the event.  I called everywhere - all the bakeries pompously replied, ""We don't do photo cakes - only grocery store chains do that! or ""You have to place an order a minimum of a week ahead."" -they made it seem like I was an irritation - not as a paying customer.   

I called Honey Moons and they said ""no problem -come on in!"" 

Our event requires a cake with a personal touch (photo of the guest of honor) - as well as extraordinary, unique and beautiful decorations.  We appreciated the large variety of fillings/cakes to choose from.  

I read a couple prior reviews who said the store was hard to find - NOT SO!  If you have an address (606 W.

Birthday cake graced the break room practically everyday but today was different. When I walked inside to sing an out of key version of the birthday song to my coworker, I noticed a masterpiece in front of my eyes. A white cake topped with the freshest of fruit and the creamiest of white chocolate morphed into a piece of artwork. One bite into the white cake filled with fresh strawberries and I was in lust. It later turned into love and I've been happy every since. 

I silently thank the coworker who introduced me to Honey Moon Sweets because I can't imagine life without knowing about this sweet Phoenix treat. Over the years, Honey Moon Sweets has been my go-to bakery for a special occasion. I've purchased the ""basic"" cake for birthday parties. Let me just note here that a basic cake from Honey Moon Sweets is practically a masterpiece in any other bakery's mind. When planning my sister's baby shower, I knew exactly where to go. I wanted the perfect cake and a work of art to grace the baby shower table. And behold the Honey Moon Sweets baby cake. It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it's reasonably priced.

Of the three specialty bakeries I tried (looking for cake rather than cupcakes), this place has the BEST TASTING CAKE COMPARED TO ANY OF THE OTHERS.  I loved the choc. cake and Bavarian cream filling.  I showed up one morning without an appointment and they let me try what they already had on hand.  I think its reasonable to assume that what I got to taste that day is a good representation of what I will get when my wedding rolls around.

Decorating:  flipping through the gallery of wedding cake pics, it seems like the cake decorators here can do just about anything.  Even the most basic options are beautiful.  The price quote I got for one such ""basic"" cake was a bit cheaper than what I was quoted for similar designs at the other places.  Once I started to look at some of the fancier options the price goes up a bit.  It seems like they charge a little more than some of the other places for sugar roses and stuff like that.

Service:  Knowledgeable, friendly, accommodating, informative and overall great, great, great.

I have gone in before to buy little cookies and cakes because they are close to my work and they were alright. I think they are a little over priced for what you get. But the reason why I give them one star is that the customer service was HORRIBLE! If I am going to be spending close to $1,000 dollars on a wedding cake for 200 people I not only expect that the food should taste great, but that the customer service is better than that. Just because you have a cake on the front of Arizona Bride does not mean the customer service goes out the window.

W8NchV1uj2drHDEpvmnQTw,YgqexscIgNoMBAO__J97zA,"I only went to one bakery to taste for my wedding cake - my new hubs actually is not a cake fan so I knew I had to be selective as I really wanted him to come and I knew he wouldn't make it to more then one tasting so I had to nail it! 

I selected Honeymoon Sweets because I knew that Whole Foods offered their desserts, and Whole Foods and I are good friends and I trust his opinion. There are some poor reviews out there, but we decided to roll the dice and wow was I glad that we did. 

We had nothing but great service from them - the phone service was a little sketchy like they were multi-tasking while talking to me, but really I can't fault them because I do the very same thing at work. What matters is that they nailed our cake. I actually came in with a sketch of how I wanted my cake to look, which is I think kind of a risky proposition versus going with a tried and true design. The sales lady checked with the cake designer and they said they could do my design, and best of all, with just buttercream frosting to support the design, which is great because fondant is nasty and $$$. So we tasted all the flavors and decided on lemon cake with raspberry mousse (yum) and chocolate cake with coconut cream (double yum). I actually changed the chocolate flavor to red velvet a few weeks before the wedding because unbeknownst to me a lot of people don't like coconut, and the red velvet was a total hit. 

So how did the design turn out??? ( I will post a photo). AMAZING. I was so nervous as I arrived at the venue and we were taking pictures my thoughts kept drifting over to the cake. I was a little freaked out thinking how it would look, again, only because of the few negative reviews, not because of anything I experienced. So finally I grew some cajones and went to look at the cake. Holy cow it was awesome. It was better then I imagined. After a few friends posted pics on facebook tons of people commented on how cool the cake was. 

So huge high five to Honey Moon Sweets. We did not have a cake with our package so we had a choice, and we are glad we chose you. The cake vendor is one you don't get to see or thank at your wedding, so I want to thank your staff and your cake designer for knocking this one out of the park!",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Honey Moon Sweets

PMBqF-RdGmke0_XTZyYGlQ,YgqexscIgNoMBAO__J97zA,"I picked up an assortment of treats to share, and they were a big hit with everyone.

Key lime tart: the lime curd was light, with just the right amount of tartness. Shortbread crust was nice and thick, and didn't crumble to pieces while eating. 

Chocolate peanut butter cake: chocolate cake with a ganache coating and a layer of peanut butter mousse. It sounds like it would be way too rich, but it really wasn't. The mousse was not overly sweet, and the ganache was thinly layered so it didn't overwhelm the cake. The cake itself was perfect.

Tres leches cake: I'm used to having fruit in my tres leches cake, so I was surprised to find that this was cinnamon flavored. Once I got past the surprise, it was delicious. The cake was moist without being soggy, and there were little granules of cinnamon sugar mixed in with the whipped cream topping to give it some texture.

Tiramisu cake: pretty standard tiramisu. There was nothing wrong with it, but it didn't wow me as much as the other three.

All of the cakes were beautifully decorated, and these were only mini-cakes. The full sized cakes and the wedding cakes that were on display in the showroom were unbelievable. Prices were very reasonable, $4 for the tart and $5 for each of the mini-cakes. Full sized fruit pies were $10.50, which is cheap for a gourmet pie. The only reason I didn't buy one is that they were sold out of my family's favorite favors. Next time, I will call in advance and special order one.

First off, if it wasn't for the GPS, we probably would've blown past this joint.  From the outside, it looks like a warehouse despite the decently large ""Bakery"" sign outside.  We were expecting a cute little shop with little cakes on display in windows and such and that didn't happen.  We're never one to judge based on the outside appearance so we parked and strolled in.  Upon entering, there's a tiny display case of sweets and a modest room of wedding cakes to the right.  Since one attendant was assisting a party order and the other was ringing up a couple other patrons, my friend and I decided to take our time looking at the delicious pastries in the case.  

I ended up buying a chocolate cake pop for Ann R.'s nephew, three German Chocolate Towers, two Key Lime Tarts, and two cupcakes with butter-cream frosting for our coffee date with Brett B. later on in the evening.

Being that the wee-tot nephew was three, he devoured his cakepop without a second thought.  I personally enjoyed the tarts more than the chocolate towers.  The tarts were so flavorful and had just the right amount of pucker that left me drooling after ever bite.  I also liked how crispy and buttery the shortbread crust was too!  The German Chocolate Towers were moist, chocolatey, but a tad too sweet for my liking.  The coconut flakes seemed to want to lodge itself in my esophagus so I didn't care for that sensation either.  I'm not sure how the cupcakes went as they were gifted but Brett B.'s grand-tot looked cute in the picture he Instagram'd!

Honeymoon Sweets was the bakery we were told we had to use in order to take advantage of the ""included cake"" with the package we had with our venue. 

The tasting they offer is one solitary cake, with chocolate cake on one layer and white cake on the other. That's it. White & chocolate to taste. Not exactly a ""tasting."" They also have spoonfuls of various fillings, but it was very difficult to see how they would combine given the limited amount of actual cake to take with each filling. And if you wanted something other than white or chocolate cake, you'd have to pay $15 for each flavor just to try it. This was not told to us ahead of time, so we left the tasting feeling deflated and very dissapointed, knowing we'd have to settle on what we wanted. 

Additionally, when doing our consultation, they were all about saying ""no that isn't possible"", ""no that isn't included"", or ""we can do that but it will be $x more per serving."" They use a tasteless buttercreme icing as well and are unwilling to do a traditional american buttercreme.

I have waited a year to write this review, hoping that maybe I would cool off from my experience...

My fiance and I went in to pick out our wedding cake, we KNEW that 3 weeks before the wedding was short notice...but we planned our wedding in 8 weeks total. 

When we arrived the lady had us wait for about 15 min...there was not one single person in the bakery...
She asked me when the wedding was and I told her the date, she laughed in my face then said, ""who told you to come here???"" (very rude)
I told her that our venue uses them...
she went into the back...took another 20 min to bring out cake samples 
(we made the appt a week in advance, I expect you to be ready and prepared when we arrive. period)
we tried the cakes, after about (literally) 3 minutes she said, ""what is your decision?"" 
-excuse me. I JUST tried the first flavor...this is our wedding cake...can we have some time to try all of the flavors?
I said, ""we aren't sure yet""
She RUDELY said, ""well I will just wait here, it isn't like I have anything else to do today..""
ACTUALLY you don't. this is your job. suck it up or quit.
we picked a flavor and then she had us wait AGAIN for her to get the color swatch.
We picked the swatch, then I asked her how much it would cost to place gum paste flowers on the cake, she then AGAIN laughed at me and said, ""well that is going to cost you a lot extra"" 
-obviously......
then proceeded with, ""and well we don't have time for that because those take 4 weeks to set before they are hard, so we can't do it all.....""
LOL for your information, I grew up in family owned bakeries...4 weeks in what world?
My husband at that point almost walked out
she kept telling us how late we were, how we couldn't upgrade our cake at all so we had to decide on a simple one or not get one.

One week later still no phone call so, I had to contact the bakery again in hopes of finding out why I did not receive the cake I ordered.

Once they finally, called me back they wanted to blame me for the mishap as though it was my fault for some reason.  They offered no type of compensation for the issue and frowned upon the fact I even asked for something.

okay all... beware of this bakery... !!!!!!   there are so many choice from home grown bakeries to franchises.  This bakery was sooo disappointing!!!!!   A wedding cake and cupcakes were ordered for a small wedding of 80 or so guests.  The flavor profiles offered were minimal and the service was at best mediocre.  Now, when a bakery states a "" mousse filling"" one would expect light fluffy and melt in your mouth.  
What was given was gritty/grainy and bitter.  When a frosting is offered as an italian meringue buttercream, it should not taste like ""grease"" or taste like it has been int he fridge for days uncovered!!!!!   The cake base was unbelievably "" dry"" .  There was a chocolate base with peanut butter mousse and a white cake with lemon mousse........  there were more uneaten cupcakes left on the table or in the trash.  The top of the wedding tower was a solitary round cake, chocolate cake with the so called buttercream frosting: it was sooo thick and tasted like grease!!!  There is even more to this... the cake was to be delivered 1 to 1.5 hours before the wedding ceremony.  the cake arrived during the wedding ceremony!!!!   The staff at the venue just threw the cupcakes on the provided stand.  The bride was so panicked: after the ceremony she was asking is the cake here.. over and over!!  She should have been focused on her special day .... 
There was absolutely no decoration on the cupcakes !!  No sugar flakes for sparkle, not even a hint of "" bling"" .  Again, I felt so bad for the bride on her special day!!

But apparently their tacos are supposedly cheap and good, which might be their saving grace, giving them benefit of a doubt and good reviews from others, they get another star.  

The 3rd star is for the pretty friendly staff and their really good spicy red sauce salsa.  The owner is an old man and he is very friendly and will help recommend u different items to try, like chicharon tacos and such.  His son is a little more quiet but service with a smile and efficient.

I think I prefer Rivas to this place as they make a decent plate with giant portions.  Only thing this place has above Rivas is their really spicy hot sauce.  The red sauce in a bottle is done right :). Also their asada is nicely grilled and almost every piece is a little crispy.  I guess the right way to do this is buy their sauce and bring it down the road to rivas :)

pApLDnYOP3CYnIn1YZS09A,HsI08PlmnA0T6s6y4oyUtw,"I am still living at enclave, and my attitude towards it has changed quite a bit since a year ago when I first moved in.

I was first drawn to its location: close to Sunflower, a yoga studio, a beauty school, a church, and some restaurants. The outside facilities -- pools, gym, grills -- looked nice enough at first glance, especially when you couldn't wait to shorten the tour in Arizona's mid-August.

I was sold quite easily. So I paid various fees and the expensive rent for a bare-boned 1 bedroom (my friend paid less to get a 2-bedroom house) and slowly discovered the deficiencies in this community.

The gym was small and way under-equipped. The walls were thin, and the appliances in my apartment were ancient -- I meant it, ancient!

Fine. Had to live with those.

Then, 7 months in, there was a major management change we were not notified of until absolutely the last minute, followed by complete chaos and lack of transitioning. We didn't get any sort of bill or statement for 3 months, and the temporary website looked very sketchy to make online payment.

So to be fair, I liked enclave's location, relatively quiet environment, landscape, and fairly responsive maintenance. What I don't like about it is that it is overpriced (no utilities were included plus various fees and insurance requirements), outdated amenities and appliances, last-minute notice on everything, and the apartments seemed to be fairly poorly built (20+ years. . .). 

Overall, I think Enclave is liveable, but could be better. It is by no means a ""high-end"" community (mostly students and families), and the service isn't there yet reflecting the value (especially after the management change). So I don't see why it needs to be priced the way it is.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,Enclave Apartments

This is physically a beautiful complex, nicely tucked in off S. Dorsey. The layout is neat, and the location is ideal... love the many trees, and how isolated it is from the busy surroundings of Tempe. So why the 2 stars? It is like an attractive person with an ugly personality. 

Every Monday, bright and early at around 7:30 AM, the landscaping crew does their thing. By their thing, I mean they have about 10 leaf blowers cranked up to full blast for hours. Wherever you are in the complex they will be blasting away right in front of your window. It is absolutely impossible to sleep through.

I have a very demanding job, and the mornings are tough. I need to do what normal people do like shower, brush my teeth, and eat breakfast. At least on 10 separate morning occasions this year, we could not help but notice that the water was randomly turned off for a few hours (and yes, the water bill was up to date). It is quite tricky to get off to a decent start without water.  

If you live on the first floor, you will most likely hear some footsteps from the people walking around above you. A few bikes, including mine got stolen recently... but they graciously left us all with front tires.

When i first moved into the Enclave i absolutely loved it. The community is great, we had great neighbors and is in a very convenient spot located to everything. The community is made up of young families and college kids. Within the first few months we had a noise complaint because we were playing our music too loud. Understandable. We did not realize the walls were so thin until we had been there for a few months. You can always here the people upstairs, whether it be them walking around or someone getting it on. 

 Halfway through our lease management changed and we were not notified until it had already happened. Grounds crew is out there every Monday morning i believe but don't really do their job... I take a walk over to the local next door (Spokes) and constantly have to walk off the sidewalks because the bushes ans trees are hanging onto the sidewalk. I remember for a week straight they just had brush that they had cut off sitting right in a walkway until i called and complained. 

Today i just got my renewal lease, and they wanted to change our rent from 965 to 1004. This apartment community is overrated and overpriced.

1. They messed up my move in date. I came to the complex with all of my belongings packed and ready to move. I had to wait over 45 minutes for the manager, Monica, to come in. It was almost 10:30 in the morning when she finally came in and had an attitude. She asked why I was here today when my move in date wasn't for two weeks. I had to prove myself to her via emails before she finally admitted any error. I should have taken this as the first sign. They did nothing to make up for any of this or the fact that I needed a place to stay in the mean time.

2. They tried to charge me an insufficient notice fee for moving out. They require 60 days notice. I gave 70 days notice. This is the second time I had to prove myself to them via email. Monica continued to try and charge me even after I moved out. I went in to the office before I had paid my final bill, which is when I saw the charge. I gave her over two weeks to call me to discuss this erroneous fee and she did not call until after I moved out. She didn't remove the fee until I threatened my lawyer.

3. I went to turn in my keys and no one was able to locate my file. This place is the most disorganized company I have ever worked with. I had to call back the next day and make sure they associated my keys with my correct file. 

4. I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY DEPOSIT BACK. I have not lived there for over a month and still have not received it.  They continue to give me the run around and lie about when they sent it out. I had to reach out to headquarters to have anything done. 

5. I have lost count of the amount of times someone has promised me a call back and never called.

Today was my friend's birthday and she was looking for some seafood in the area since we were taking a lunch break. Pete's Fish and Chips was thrown around as an option, but she decided on Joe's Crab Shack. Seeing how it's her day for a super happy birthday extravaganza of fun, I conceded. And all I have to report on the experience is coupled with a shrug and an, ""Eh.""

If you like the corporate atmosphere of TGI Fridays or Bennigan's or any of those other places where they put shit on the walls, you'll probably enjoy Joe's Crab Shack. You'll be prepared for the pitfalls as well. It's overpriced and under-seasoned. It's dried out when fried up. It's unoriginal and bland. But if you douse everything with malt vinegar and tartar sauce, I contend that even cardboard would go down smooth.

I've been here several times on others' bill, and have left with the same lackluster impression and a belly full of grease.

My fiance's parents love the Crab Shack.  Every year, we all spend a week in Coronado, California for a much-needed escape from the desert.  Every year, we find ourselves driving across the bridge into San Diego in search of a crappy seafood dinner courtesy of Joe and his under-motivated teenage staff.  Every year, my meal both amazes and disappoints me.  How awful is a restaurant when it just keeps getting worse?  I am totally certain that the kitchen contains nothing but enormous bags of frozen seafood and deep-fryers the size of swimming pools.

One time, we had a waiter that kept calling all the men ""bro.""  I am not your bro.  I am paying for and eating food that would get even a Red Lobster cook fired and, as such, am entitled to no less than five-star treatment.

If there is anything positive to say, it is that the bibs they hand out to people eating crab are HILARIOUS.  I've got the pictures to prove it.

I'll visit the Shack once per year out of obligation.  I'll even be (sort of) happy to do it, considering those close to me seem to love it and I'm not going to rain on their parade.

The $30 I just got for Joe's Crab Shack was such a dilemma. So Hubby and I went yesterday since we would be in the area anyway. Our expectations were pretty low, so some elements of the meal actually met or even exceeded those expectations.

We had the seafood fondue appetizer, which was OK, but complete garbage compared to Pappadeaux's. Hubby had the shrimp po-boy which came in a traditional presentation but with fried shrimp that he described as one step above cocktail shrimp. I myself would not have taken it so far, and out of pity, I gave him a bunch of superior shrimp from my platter. I had a reasonably decent mix of coconut, Parmesan panko, and seasoned fried shrimp. I also made the wise choice of asking for a sub of onion rings instead of fries. Hubby's fries were inedible, as if they had been triple fried. Hard as a rock. My onion rings were thin and mostly crispy. At least they tasted fresh. 

When the bill came, we were rather shocked. It was pretty pricey at over $40 for lunch. Frankly, I wasn't all that thrilled about spending nearly $20 (with tip) after my gift card was applied. When you consider that we would have gotten a far superior meal at Pete's Fish and Chips for about $12, Joe's is a sad place- no wonder they were practically empty.

The bowl has decreased by at least 1/2 in the size that it used to be (this was supposed to be my MEAL, i didn't order a cup), and the potatoes were raw and crunchy.  As i'm picking them out of my bowl, the manager came up to us (fairly late into our meal) and apologized about not being able to prepare the salmon as ordered.  Then she goes to explain that they can't cook it less than well done because it's FROZEN and packaged.  Really? Isn't this a seafood restaurant?  I then told her that the potatoes are raw.  The manager then offered to cook me ""another bag of clam chowder"".  I just looked up in disgust, now.  The clam chowder, which had always been one of the yummiest dishes there, is PREPACKAGED?   If i wanted frozen fish and prepacked chowder, i could have saved money and gotten similar quality at Long John Silvers.  
My husband got the Grilled Malibu Shrimp.  Average to say the least, surrounded with dry, mushy, over cooked (was frozen) broccoli.  The best thing that we were served was the Applesauce cup that my son got as a side for his Popcorn shrimp.

After that, I took it upon myself to never buy food again at Starbucks until they came to their senses and got rid of La Boulange. So now any time I stop, it's JUST for drinks. Which in itself can be a nightmare.This past Saturday, I visited Starbucks on East Blvd for an iced coffee. I took the only parking spot that was left in their bumpy, pothole-y, limited-space parking lot. I was happy to see that the line to order was incredibly short and quickly placed my order. What I didn't notice was the throng of people surrounding the other end of the counter, waiting for their drinks. While the SB employees appeared to be working very quickly, the demand was more than they could reasonably handle and produce. (Hey, SB managers -- how about scheduling more employees for one of the busiest times of the day?)While waiting for almost 10 minutes for my simple, basic iced coffee (pouring it from a pitcher into a cup), I looked around the establishment. They've recently renovated (again) and, if it's possible, there is even less seating to meet the demand of the number of people that frequent this particular restaurant. For one thing, there are fewer individual tables. For another, there aren't enough chairs to even accommodate those tables. There were empty tables with no chairs around them! They've also gone with the space-hogging long community tables, like anyone who goes to SB with a book, laptop, friend, etc. wants to sit closely with another party. One thing that used to make SB great was the intimacy it provided for its patrons. I guess that's out the refurbished window. The drink delay also gave me a chance to get a really good look at the cleanliness of the tables, and especially the common area with the cream, sugar, etc. It was not replenished and filthy. FIL-THY. The garbage was overflowing onto the counter. It looked abandoned. Someone really needed to get out on the floor (hello, manager again!) and CLEAN. THINGS. UP.  The outside seating wasn't much cleaner.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,Starbucks- 1568 E Blvd.Dilworth.

Story: I arrived at 5:50 am on a weekday to finish report cards and at the time was the only customer seated in Starbucks. Three employees started to engage in a personal conversation, that was entirely too loud. I was seated across the room and could here their full conversation. This went on for about 10 minutes. I understand they were not busy at this time of the morning and having personal conversations, however the lack of customer awareness and the volume of their speaking was very disappointing. 

There also was no music playing ( I really just wanted that coffee shop music and get in that work zone). I asked if they could turn it on and a employee said it was broke.

And the coffee wasn't that great either, and was over priced as usual. They need more parking or more signs to warn people of this.

It's the only location that has asked for my name like they're supposed to, especially when they're busy. (the first time I visited, they didn't, but it seems they were on it the second time around). The staff are friendly and they do a great job with the drinks.

It's also the most unique Starbucks I've ever been in. Located in an old house, it's not anything like the other Starbucks, other than the counter of course. There is so much seating here, too.

I would only complain about the floor outlets as they don't seem to work for charging your computer. But no other Starbucks I know of has floor outlets. I don't think Starbucks intended people use the floor outlets; I think they were just there previously before the Starbucks moved in. The wall outlets work great. 

It's a busy location, just so you know. You can expect a little delay in your drink but that happens with the business.

They don't have a drive thru as there's no space for one here. That's not a big deal for me, however, because I take the bus anyway. Public transit is pretty good in Charlotte, though it does tend to run a bit later than scheduled. But buses run late at night as well as the light rail. I would recommend getting to this Starbucks via public transportation just because the parking looks like it could be a little crazy. It's not far from the East/West Blvd Lynx light rail station and it's just one bus ride away, just take route 25 there. 

I still want to check out the Steele Creek Starbucks as I've heard good things about it but I think the East Blvd Starbucks will be my regular Starbucks from this point on.",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,Starbucks- 1568 E Blvd.Dilworth.

Additionally they have run out of breakfast sandwiches a few times now, including today, and its not like I got there too late or anything.
